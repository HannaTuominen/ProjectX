chapter = Chapter

chapter1_1= A young person named Alex wakes up stranded on a small island \nand is unaware what has happened: where is he and how did he \nget there? Alex starts to seek a way out from the island and his \ngaze is drawn to tree... 
chapter1_2= At the tree bunch of survival documents come to his mind and \nhe summons ungodly powers and rips the tree off of the ground with \nits roots.
chapter1_3= He starts to build a raft which seems to be an easy job to do. \nUnfortunately, it looks like there is not enough wood for \nboth oars and sails. So, he must choose one. 

chapter2_1= Sailing the sea Alex starts to show some signs of desperation.\n He looks to the horizon with the spyglass he happened to \nhave with him and sees an island and smoke coming out of it.
chapter2_2= He decides to proceed to the possibly inhabited island. \nHe still doesn’t have any idea where he is, so he prepares for the worst.

chapter3_1= As soon as Alex gets to the shore, he is attacked by hostile \nand isolated folk known as “harvantalaiset”. \nThere is no time for introductions, so Alex decides to flee for his life.
chapter3_2= One of the arrows shot by natives hits Alex’s neck but he still keeps running.

chapter4_1= Alex has shaken off the harvantalaiset but the arrow \nthat hit him clearly contained something that mixed up his head.
chapter4_2= Now Alex must decide: does he trust the Burger turtle that promises \nto lead him to safety or just simply start running to a \nrandom direction while he is all messed up?!

chapter5_1= After wandering a while Alex finds a campsite that looks abandoned. \nHe also finds some water, food and tent that\nmay have belonged to some researcher studying the native people.
chapter5_2= Some weird noise wakes Alex up in the middle of the night and he \nsees a flare in the sky.\nHe thinks that this might be his \nchance to get off this damned island and back to civilisation by
chapter5_3= helping this stranger. He gets up fast and forgets all his \nequipment at the camp.

chapter6_1= Alex decides to go help this poor fisherman who got attacked \nby harvanta people. With the help from him and his boat it \nmight be possible to get back to civilization. But the \nquestion is how will
chapter6_2= Alex make the diversion? Chances are the fisherman soon \nwon't be able to make it. Alex decides to be a \ndaredevil and just charge towards the harvanta people \nshouting at the same time.
chapter6_3= The harvanta people don't know what to think about the \nsituation and start falling back, scratching their heads in confusion.\n Alex too is a bit confused that his diversion \nreally worked. The most important thing is that the fisherman is ok.

chapter7_1= Alex and the fisherman make it out of the situation and \nare now in clear waters. They both think that it would be best if they \nboth got some sleep and decide to do it in turns
chapter7_2= so they could avoid the kind of situations they got into at the \nisland. However, Alex is sure that the situation couldn’t turn any
chapter7_3= worse and goes to sleep peacefully.

chapter8_1= Alex wakes up in the morning because of an enormous jolt and is \nterrified to realize they have just hit an iceberg. Alex’s only hope \nis to jump over onto iceberg, even when he is not
chapter8_2= certain about how future goes. On top of that, the fisherman \nhas taken the lifeboat and fled with it with all their food and equipment. 
chapter8_3= Why did the fisherman betray Alex after he had saved him? \nAnd why did this Titanic-like situation happen to him.

chapter9_1= Alex jumps onto to iceberg which boat crashed on to and just \nkeeps thinking that here we are again on \nsquare one. No clue where I am, what has happened and
chapter9_2= how I get back home. Luckily he isn’t the only one in the \nsame situation. There is also a lonely penguing. Let’s call him Albert.
chapter9_3= Alex is on the brink of despair. But on the other hand he won’t \nstarve because of his new penguin friend Albert who keeps bringing \nhim raw fish. And this isn’t exactly a bad thing because
chapter9_4= Alex loves sushi even though he doesn’t really care for the \nrisk of getting tapeworms. This must be the beginning of a great \nfriendship.

chapter10_1= Alex and Albert have been on the iceberg for several days \nand it has started melting fast, thanks to the climate change. \nIn the end Alex has nothing to worry about because Albert,
chapter10_2= who has become quite keen on Alex, keeps bringing more fish \nand the dehydration is easily solved by licking the iceberg. \nAlex keeps thinking that he could get used to this but
chapter10_3= still he doesn’t give up on getting back to civilization.

chapter11_1= It’s one of those days when there are no clouds in the sky \nand the sun keeps burning mercilessly. It is almost like in the \nsummer of 2018. But this day may also have its perks,
chapter11_2= as an ancient Viking canoe emerges slowly from inside the \niceberg. Is this his salvation? Or will things go like they \ndid in the fisherman-episode? Alex doesn’t take any risk and sits
chapter11_3= immediately in the canoe. It would be a bummer to get left \nbehind of this ride because it could be his end. Finally Alex \nhas to decide what to do with his loyal friend Albert – should
chapter11_4= Alex leave him behind or take him along?

chapter12_1= The journey at the sea continues because you know Albert, \nhe forced himself to come no matter what. However, Alex notices an ancient \npaper in the canoe which contains weird looking text. At this
chapter12_2= moment, Alex realizes, for the first time in his life, \nlearning old Norse pays off because he understands what the odd \nsymbols mean in the text. Alex starts to read the ancient text
chapter12_3= aloud while Albert listens. The text seems odd...\nit happens to be an ancient incantation which was \nused to summon Kraken to help in the battle. At the same time
chapter12_4= the water starts to bubble...

chapter13_1= The mythical creature Kraken arises from the water \nand lets out his mighty battlecry: “RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR”.
chapter13_2= Two friends are sure they have met their doom. Albert just keeps \nspinning around waving his wings while Alex is just frozen and \nthinking that this is it. GG. But it is not over.
chapter13_3= Albert pulls himself together and starts to seek a solution. \nWhile the Kraken is rampaging Albert picks up a hammer from under \nan elk skin lying in canoe. And what is that hammer; It is the
chapter13_4= mythical hammer, Mjolnir.

chapter14_1= Albert, this heroic penguin picks up and throws the Mjolnir, \ntowards the Kraken. The Kraken is K.O and falls down to the sea and \nso does the Mjolnir. Albert and Alex are victorious because
chapter14_2= they didn’t meet their maker just yet. At the same time \nthunderclouds appear in the sky and a lighting storm begins. Between the \nclouds arrives Thor, this mythical hero and eyecandy for women.
chapter14_3= Thor raises his hand and Mjolnir comes to his hand from \nthe sea. Thor thanks and says that he has been looking for his \nhammer for quite some time. Thor also promises that hero 
chapter14_4= penguins like Albert have always a place in Asgard.

chapter15_1= After defeating the Kraken Albert and Alex are excited \nand hug each other. After a while they yet realize they are in \ntrouble. The situation hasn’t improved in any way, even though
chapter15_2= they slayed the Kraken and Thor praised Albert because \nof his heroism. So what. They are still in the middle of an \nocean without any knowledge about their whereabouts and how are
chapter15_3= they going to get home. Then they heard a sound of a plane \nfrom a distance and Albert starts to wave his hands. Alex \nlooks up to the sky and sees a seaplane. This must be their
chapter15_4= salvation. Nothing could mess this up anymore. Alex finds \nan antique mirror under the elk hind and starts to mimic \nAlbert with his hand waving to get the pilot's attention.
chapter15_5= The plane turns and seems to be landing. Alex hopes that \nthis is it. 

chapter16_1= The seaplane lands right next to the canoe. A moment \nlater the plane opens and reveals a 50-years-old, gray \nhaired but good-looking international adventurer named Timothy Longor.
chapter16_2= He has seen everu rainforests, temples and lost \ncity you can possibly think. He also explains how Alex’s \nmother has hired him to find her son because she was worried about
chapter16_3= him after she hadn’t heard anything about him after a \nstudent party. At this moment Alex starts to get a hold of \nwhat happened. He remembers how he was at some kind of student party
chapter16_4= and after that he woke up on the island. But there's \nno time for reminiscing now. The task is to get back home.
chapter16_5= Albert and Alex get on the plane.

chapter17_1= After the plane takes off, Alex and Albert sits down.\n The plane is surprisingly comfy eventhough it is propably\n at least 50 years old. But nothing else matters at the moment but
chapter17_2= the fact that they will soon be home. Timothy asks Alex\n how he is feeling? Alex answers that he is relieved because\n Timothy came to rescue him. Alex tells Timothy that he owes
chapter17_3= him a great deal and he also would offer him a drink when\n they get back to civilization. Timothy laughs and says that\n he will hold on to that promise. Timothy seems to be a nice
chapter17_4= fellow but Albert doesn't seem to get along with him. \nAlbert just growls to Timothy in the cockpit and Alex tries to\n calm him down. Alex also starts to feel bad vibes coming
chapter17_5= from the cockpit. Timothy is calling to someone. \nThe person answering sounds like Alex's mother. Timothy tells her \nthey are on their way to home. Alex mumbles to himself that
chapter17_6= the bad vibes were only his imagination. Soon sounds of\n argument are heard from the cockpit. Timothy demands that \nhis payment should be doubled to which Alex's mother answers,
chapter17_7= stuttering, that she cannot afford that. Timothy says \nthat he is sorry and hopes that her son can fly because the plane\n is going to get lighter. Albert and Alex look at
chapter17_8= each other and know that they need to act fast... Will Albert or Alex attack Timothy and take his place in the cockpit?

chapter18_1= The situation is threatning beacuse the person controlling \nthe plane doesn’t have that much flying experience (and \nwith that I mean none). The plane starts to lose altitude.
chapter18_2= The international adventurer is unconscious and knocking \nhim was perhaps not the smartest idea. Albert starts to \nlook for parachutes because the plane won’t stay in the
chapter18_3= air much longer. The only comforting thing is they seemed \nto be back to civilization when Alex looked out of the \nwindow. Albert brings back two parachutes. Alex thinks that
chapter18_4= they both could use them but on the other hand they can’t \nleave this international scum to crash down with the plane. \nSo he takes one of the parachutes and puts it on,
chapter18_5= and put the other one to the international adventurer. \nAlex jumps out of the plane with Albert on his shoulders and \npulls the adventurer out of the plane at the same time.

chapter19_1= Floating down is pretty relaxing and the view isn't too \nbad. At the same time the international \nadventurer descends far from Alex and Albert. Soon the situation
chapter19_2= starts to seem bad again because the two are going hard towards \na tree. They crash hard but the last branch of the tree \nsaves them because the parachute got stuck to it. Now they are
chapter19_3= hanging from a tree and thinking about how they could get down. \nAlbert starts to flounder and faceplants to ground. \nThe drop isn’t that big. Alex opens his harness and falls
chapter19_4= straight into Albert's hands.

chapter20_1= Alex and Albert had barely made it back to the ground. In the \ndistance they hear some car noise so they have to be \nclose to a road. They decide to head towards the noise, hoping
chapter20_2= that it wouldn’t be long till they are back home. At the road both \nof them started lift up their thumbs in hope of \ngetting a ride. And it doesn’t take long until a car stops, and a couple opens
chapter20_3= the door, because they are excited about a penguin.\n So the battered adventurers get in the car which is headed to Tampere.
chapter20_4= Is Alex about to get home?

chapter21_1= The friends are just sitting silently on the backseat of the car. \nThe silence starts to be unbearable and the woman sitting \nin the front seat breaks the ice. The woman says that
chapter21_2= Albert and Alex seem like they have gone through a lot. She also \nasks if they’d like to talk about it because they still \nhave some time before they reach Tampere. Alex takes
chapter21_3= a deep breath and thinks to himself where to start. He still doesn’t\n have any idea how he got into this mess and how long \nhe has been away from home. Still Alex tells the
chapter21_4= outline of their story and the front seat is silent again. After a \nmoment the woman tells Alex that she is a \nreporter and would like to tell their story
chapter21_5= to the rest of the world. Alex agrees to this and the woman gives \nhim her business card.

chapter22_1= Alex gets off the car and grabs Albert also. The reporter reminds \nAlex about the coming interview before the car takes off.
chapter22_2= Alex is finally home. Albert and Alex head out to the apartment. \nAt the door Alex reaches out for his pocket and laughs
chapter22_3= because he still has his keys after the adventure. Alex \ndecides to order a pizza because he is too tired to make any food.
chapter22_4= He just wants to eat, take a long shower and go to sleep so he \ncould start to make some sense of the adventure.
chapter22_5= Alex looks at Albert sitting on a chair and thinks out loud what to \ndo with him. Albert coughs and says: “As memorable our \njourney has been, I must go because my people needs me.
chapter22_6= I just wanted to see you get home safely.” After that Albert takes \npilot glasses out of his pocket, opens up a window and \nflies away.
chapter22_7= Alex sits down on the floor and lets out a laugh - nothing that \nis happening cannot be real. The pizza arrives.

chapter23_1= Alex has eaten his pizza and taken his long shower. However \nhe doesn’t have the strength to walk to his bed. He just \nlays down on the floor. Just a moment before he falls
chapter23_2= asleep his cellphone rings. Some student is calling him and \nasking if he would be interested in coming to a student party \nlater. The Burger turtle shows up and advises him
chapter23_3= to consider carefully because the last time he was partying he \nwoke up in the next morning stranded on an uncharted island. \nAlex just lies there and thinks what to do.
chapter23_4= This could be the opportunity to learn what happened at the previous party.
