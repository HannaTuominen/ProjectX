chapter1_1= A young person named Alex wakes up stranded on a small island \nand is unaware what has happened: where is he and how did he \nget there? Alex starts to seek a way out from the island and his \neyes hits a tree... 
chapter1_2= At the tree bunch of survival documents come to his mind and \nhe summons ungodly powers and rips the tree off of the ground with \nits roots.
chapter1_3= He starts to build a raft which seems to be a piece of cake. \nUnfortunately, it looks like there is not enough wood for \nboth oars and sails. So, he must choose one. 

chapter2_1= Sailing the sea Alex starts to show some signs of desperation.\n He looks to the horizon with the binocular he happened to \nhave with him and sees an island and smoke coming out of it.
chapter2_2= He decides to proceed to the possibly inhabited island. \nHe still doesn’t have any idea where he is, so he prepares for the worst.

chapter3_1= As soon as Alex gets to ashore, he is attacked by hostile \nand isolated folk known as “harvantalaiset”. \nThere is no time for introductions, so Alex decides to flee for his life.
chapter3_2= Regardless one of the arrows shot by native’s hits Alex’s neck but he still keeps running.

chapter4_1= Alex has shaken of the harvantalaiset but one of their arrow \ndid hit him and clearly it contained something that mixed up his head.
chapter4_2= Now Alex must decide do he trust the Burger turtle that promises \nto lead him to safety or just simply start running to a \nrandom direction while he is all messed up?!

chapter5_1= After wondering a while Alex finds a campsite that looks abandoned \ncamp-site. He also finds some water, food and tent that\nmay have belonged to some researcher studying the native people.
chapter5_2= Some weird noise wakes Alex up in the middle of the night and he \nsees a flare in the sky.\nHe thinks that this might be his \nchance to get off this damned island and back to civilisation by
chapter5_3= helping this stranger. He gets up fast and forgets all his \nequipment at the camp.

chapter6_1= Alex decides to go help this poor fisherman who got attacked \nby harvanta people. With the help of that fisher and his boat it \nmight be possible to get back to civilization. But the \nquestion is how will
chapter6_2= Alex make the diversion? There is no time to waste because at \nthis rate the fisher isn’t going to make it. Alex decides to be a \ndaredevil and just charge towards the harvanta people \nshouting at the same time.
chapter6_3= The harvanta people doens’t know what to think about the \nsituation and start falling back scratching their heads while they \nare at it. Alex too is a bit confused that his diversion \nreally worked. The most important thing is that the fisher is ok.

chapter7_1= Alex and the fisher make it barely out of the situation and \nare in clear waters. They both think that it would be best if they \nboth got some sleep and decide to do it by turns
chapter7_2= so they could avoid the kind of situations they were in last \nisland. However, Alex is sure that the situation couldn’t turn any
chapter7_3= worse and goes to sleep peacefully.

chapter8_1= Alex wakes up in the morning because an enormous jolt and is \nterrified to realize they had just hit an iceberg. Alex’ only hope \nis to jump over to iceberg, even when he is not
chapter8_2= certain about how future goes. On top of that the fisherman \nhas taken the safetyboat and fled with it with all their food and equipment. 
chapter8_3= Why did the fisherman betray Alex after he had saved him? \nAnd why did this Titanic-like situation happen to him.

chapter9_1= Alex jumps on to iceberg which boat crashed on to. While \nbeing on the iceberg Alex just keeps thinking that here we are again on \nsquare one. No clue where I am, what has happened and
chapter9_2= how I get back home. Luckily he ain’t the only one in the \nsame situation. There is also a lonely penguing. Let’s call him Albert.
chapter9_3= Alex is on brink of despair. But on the other hand he won’t \nstarve because of his new penguin friend Albert that keeps bringing \nhim raw fish. And this isn’t exactly a bad thing because
chapter9_4= Alex loves sushi even though he doesn’t really care for the \nrisk of getting tapeworm. This must be the beginning of a great \nfriendship.

chapter10_1= Alex and Albert have been on the iceberg for several days \nand it has started melting fast, thanks to the climate change. \nIn the end Alex has nothing to worry about because Albert
chapter10_2= who has become quite keen on Alex, keeps bringing more fish \nand the dehydration is easily solved by licking the iceberg. \nAlex keeps thinking that he could get used to this but
chapter10_3= still he doesn’t give up on getting back to civilisation.

chapter11_1= It’s one of those days when there are no clouds in the sky \nand the sun keeps burning mercilessly. It almost reminds of the \nsummer of 2018. But this day may also have its perks,
chapter11_2= as an ancient viking canoe begins to reveal itself from the \niceberg. Is this his salvation? Or does this end up like the \nfisherman-episode did? Alex doesn’t take any risk but sits
chapter11_3= immediately to the canoe. It would be a bummer to get left \nbehind of this ride because it could be his end. Finally, Alex \nmust decide what to do with his loyal friend Albert – should
chapter11_4= Alex leave him behind or take him along?

chapter12_1= At the sea the journey continues because you know Albert, \nhe could not be left behind. However, Alex notices an ancient \npaper in the canoe which contains weird looking text. At this
chapter12_2= moment, Alex realizes, for the first time in his life, \nlearning old norse pays off because he understands what the odd \nmarks mean in the text. Alex starts to read the ancient text
chapter12_3= aloud while Albert listens. The text seems odd and the \ntext that Alex is reading happens to be an ancient note which was \nused to summon Kraken to help in the battle. At the same time
chapter12_4= the water starts to bubble... 

chapter13_1= Mythical creature Kraken arises from the water on shouts \nhis mighty battlecry: “RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWR”.
chapter13_2= The friends are sure about their doom. Albert just keeps \nspinning around waving his wings while Alex is just frozen and \nthinking about that this is it. GG. But it is not over.
chapter13_3= Albert pulls himself together and starts to seek a solution. \nWhile the kraken is rampaging Albert picks up a hammer under \nan elk’s skin. And what is that hammer. It is the also
chapter13_4= mythical hammer, Mjolnir.

chapter14_1= Albert this heroic penguin picks up and throws the mjolnir \ntowards the kraken. The kraken is K.O and falls to the sea and \nso does the mjolnir. Alber and alex are victorious because
chapter14_2= they didn’t meet their maker just yet. At the same time \nthunderclouds appear in sky and it starts lightning. Between the \nclouds arrives Thor this mythical hero and eyecandy for women.
chapter14_3= Thor arises his hand and mjölnir comes to his hand from \nthe sea. Thor thanks and says that he has been looking for his \nhammer for quite some time. Thor also promises that hero 
chapter14_4= penguin like Albert has always a place in Asgard.

chapter15_1= After defeating the kraken Albert and Alex are excited \nand hug each other. After a while they yet realize they are in \ntropuble. The situation hasn’t improved in any way, even thought
chapter15_2= they slayed the kraken and Thor praised Albert because \nof his heroism. So what. They are still in the middle of an \nocean without any knowledge about their whereabouts and how are
chapter15_3= they going to get home. The they heard a sound of a plane \nfrom a distance and Albert started to wave his hands. Alex \nlooks up on to the sky and sees a seaplane. This must be their
chapter15_4= salvation. Nothing could mess this up anymore. Alex finds \nan antique mirror under the elk hind and starts to mimic \nAlbert with his hand waving to get the pilots attention.
chapter15_5= The plane turns and seems to be landing. Alex hopes that \nthis is it. 

chapter16_1= The seaplane lands right next to the canoe. A moment \nlater the planes door opens and reveals a 50-years old, gray \nhaired but good-looking international adventurer named Timothy Longor.
chapter16_2= He has seen all possible rainforests, temples and lost \ncities you can possibly think. He also explains how Alex’s \nmother has hired him to find her son because she was worried about
chapter16_3= him after she hadn’t heard anything about him after a \nstudent party. At this moment Alex starts to get a hold of \nwhat happened. He remembers how he was at some kind of student party
chapter16_4= and after that he woke up on the island. But now was \nnot the time for reminiscence. The task was to get home.
chapter16_5= Albert and Alex got up on the plane.

chapter18_1= The situation is threatning beacuse the person controlling \nthe plane doesn’t have that much flying experience (and \nwith that I mean none). The plane starts to lose altitude.
chapter18_2= The international adventurer is unconcious  and knocking \nhim out may not been the smartest idea. Albert starts to \nlook for parachutes because the plane wouldn’t stay in the
chapter18_3= air much longer. The only comforting thing was they seemed \nto be back to civilization when Alex looked out of the \nwindow. Albert brings back two parachutes. Alex thinks that
chapter18_4= they both could use them but on the other hand they can’t \nleave this international scum to crash down with the plane. \nSo he takes one of the parachutes and wears it by himself
chapter18_5= and puts the other one to the international adventurer. \nAlex jumps out of the plane with Albert on his shoulders and \npulling the adventurer out of the plane at the same time.

chapter19_1= Floating down was pretty relaxing and there was nothing \nbad at the views either. At the same time the international \nadventurer floats far from Alex and Albert. Soon the situation
chapter19_2= starts to seem bad again because the two are go hard towards \na tree. They crash hard but the last branch of the tree \nsaves them because the parachute got stuck to it. Now they are
chapter19_3= hanging from a tree and thinking about how they could get down. \nAlbert starts to flounder and faceplants to ground. \nThe drop isn’t that big. Alex opens up his harness and falls
chapter19_4= straight to Alberts hands.

chapter20_1= Alex and Albert had barely made back to the ground. From a \ndistance they heard some car noises, so they had to be \nclose to a road.  They decided to head towards the noise, hoping
chapter20_2= that it wouldn’t be ong till they were home. At the road both \nof them started to lift in hope of getting a ride. And it \ndoesn’t take long until a car stops, and a couple opens
chapter20_3= the door, because they were excited about a penguin. So the \nhard experienced adventures gets in the in the car which is \nheaded to Tampere.
chapter20_4= Is Alex about to get home?

chapter21_1= The friends a just sitting silently on the backseat of the car. \nThe silence starts to be unbearable and the women sitting \nin the front seat breaks the ice. The women says that
chapter21_2= Albert and Alex seems like they have gone through a lot. She also \nasks if they’d like to talk about it because they still \nhave some time before they reach Tampere. Alex takes
chapter21_3= a deep breath and thinks to himself where to start. He still doesn’t\n have any idea how he got into this mess and how long \nhas he been away from home. Still Alex tells the
chapter21_4= outlines of their story and the frontseat is silent again. After a \nmoment the comes and tells to Alex that she is a \nreporter and would like to tell the story of those two
chapter21_5= for the rest of the world. Alex agrees to this and the women gives \nhim her business card.

chapter22_1= Alex gets of the car and grabs Albert also. The reporter reminds \nAlex about the coming interview before the car takes off.
chapter22_2= Alex is finally home. Albert and Alex heads out to the apartment: \nAt the door Alex reaches out for his pocket and laughs
chapter22_3= for the fact he still has his keyes after the adventure. Alex \ndecides to order a pizza because he is too tired to make any food.
chapter22_4= He just wants to eat, take a long shower and go to sleep so he \ncould tomorrow start to make some sense out of the adventure.
chapter22_5= Alex looks Albert sitting on a chair and thinks out loud what to \ndo with him. Albert coughs and says: “As memorable our \njourney has been, I must go because my people needs me.
chapter22_6= I just wanted to see you get home safely.” After that Albert takes \npilot glasses out of his pocket, opens up a window and \nflies away.
chapter22_7= Alex sits down to the floor and laughs that nothing that \nis happening cannot be real. The pizza arrives.

chapter23_1= Alex has eaten his pizza and taken his long shower. However, \nhe doesn’t have the strength to walk for his bed. He just \nlays down to the floor. Just a moment before he falls
chapter23_2= asleep his cellphone rings. Some student is calling him and \nasking if he would be interested in coming to a student party \nlater. The burgerturtle shows up and advises him
chapter23_3= to consider carefully because last time he was partying he \nwoke up in the next morning stranded in a uncharted island. \nAlex just lays down and thinks what to do.
chapter23_4= This could be the opportunity to learn what happened at the last party.
